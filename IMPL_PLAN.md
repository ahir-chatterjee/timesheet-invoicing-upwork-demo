# Timesheet Tracking and Client Invoicing System Implementation Plan

## Background
Many staffing companies struggle with manual timesheet tracking and invoicing processes, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and delayed payments. The current workflow at our target company relies on a fragile combination of Airtable and other no-code tools, resulting in frequent errors, missing information, and time-consuming manual reconciliation. This leads to delayed billing cycles, strained client relationships, and additional administrative burden.

Employees submit weekly timesheets that need to be validated, approved by clients, and then converted into invoices. The manual nature of this process creates opportunities for errors, duplicate entries, and missing information. Administrative staff spend significant time chasing missing timesheets, reconciling discrepancies, and manually creating invoices.

## Problem Statement
The company needs an automated system to streamline the collection of employee timesheets, facilitate client approval, and generate accurate invoices. The system must replace the existing error-prone manual process with a reliable, efficient workflow that minimizes administrative overhead and improves the billing cycle.

## Service Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Ingest and store timesheet data for employees
2. Automatically identify and flag missing timesheets
3. Provide a client portal for timesheet review and approval
4. Generate downloadable invoice PDFs based on approved timesheets
5. Filter and display timesheet data by client
6. Support approval/rejection of individual timesheets with comments
7. Prepare structured data for accounting system integration (future QuickBooks integration)

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. User-friendly interface accessible to both administrative staff and clients
2. Responsive design for desktop and mobile access
3. Secure access controls to ensure data privacy
4. Reliable data processing with validation checks
5. Extendable architecture to support future integrations
6. Performance that supports concurrent users during peak periods
7. Maintainable codebase with modern practices
